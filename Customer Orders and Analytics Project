--In this project, I used SQLite Studio and a premade database of customer and order data to answer specific qustions that would be useful in real life.

--#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
--Answer: 9681

--#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';
--Answer: 379

--#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
WHERE customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
AND customers.order_id<>'OrderID'
AND customers.order_id IS NOT NULL;

--#4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT JanSales.Product, MIN(JanSales.price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales JanSales
WHERE JanSales.orderID IS NOT NULL
AND JanSales.orderID <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY JanSales.Product;
--Answer: AAA Batteries (4 pack) for $2.99.

--#5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

--#6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

--#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(FebSales.Quantity)*FebSales.price AS avg_amount_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON FebSales.OrderID=customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(customers.order_id)=6
AND customers.order_ID <> 'Order ID';
--Answer: 278 Customers, AVG amount spent = $12.79
