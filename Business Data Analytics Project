--In this project, I used a premade database in SQLiteStudio to analyze data in a way that would be useful for the business.

--#1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

--#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
--The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceDate, customers.Country
FROM chinook.customers customers
JOIN chinook.invoices invoices
ON customers.Customerid = invoices.CustomerId
WHERE customers.Country = 'Brazil'
GROUP BY customers.firstname;

--#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales%Agent%';

--#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
--The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT employees.LastName, employees.Firstname, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees employees
JOIN chinook.Customers customers ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices invoices ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId;

--#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
