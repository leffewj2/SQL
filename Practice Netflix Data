--In this excercise, I took premade Netflix data tables and found specific information about the data within--

--#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)--
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
WHERE titles.type = 'Movie';

--#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT (max(titles.date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles;

--#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT titles.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ORDER BY titles.title asc;

--#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

--#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT titles.title, titles.release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
WHERE titles.type='Movie'
ORDER BY titles.release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
